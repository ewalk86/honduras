##### Convert Dataset from Wide to Long #####
```{r}
r00_exposure_long <- r00_exposure_wide %>% 
  #transform data to long format with only 3 columns
  gather(key = "variable", value = "value", -house_id) %>% 
  #arrange data by house_id, descending
  arrange(house_id)

r00_exposure_repeated_by_phase <- r00_exposure_long %>%
  #separate variable to create new phase column
  separate(variable, c("variable", "phase"), sep = "_r00_p") %>%
  mutate(value = if_else(value == ".", "99999", value)) %>% 
  replace_with_na(replace = list(value = 99999)) %>% 
  #spread out into columns, grouped by house_id and phase
  group_by(house_id, phase) %>% 
  spread(key = "variable", value = "value") %>% 
  arrange(house_id) 

# Check number of house_id
n_distinct(r00_exposure_repeated_by_phase$house_id)
```


# Save dataset
##### Combine with full dataset in "r00_initial_data_cleaning.rmd"
```{r}
write_rds(r00_exposure_repeated_by_phase, 
          "output/r00_exposure_repeated_by_phase.rds")
